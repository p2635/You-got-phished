# You-got-phished
An idea I came up with to educate others to be careful clicking links, even if you received it from a family member, friend or a colleague. Think of it as [Rickrolling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rickrolling). Phishrolling?

Here is how it's going to work if you're an anime fan. You are going to send them a message with a convincing link text. An example is "Hey check out this youtube video for the new Bleach series they just released!'. The 'Bleach series' part being the link text of course, link that to this page.
