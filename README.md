# You Got Phished
An random idea I came up with to educate others to be careful clicking links, even if you received it from a family member, friend or a colleague. What better way than to trick them yourself? Think of it as [Rickrolling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rickrolling). Phishrolling?

## Here is how it's going to work.
You are going to send them a message with a convincing link text. Example if you're an anime fan.

Message: "Hey check out this youtube video for the new Bleach series they just released!'.

Copy this link ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘‰ https://p2635.github.io/You-got-phished/

Then modify it so it looks like this: "Hey check out this youtube video for the new [Bleach series](https://p2635.github.io/You-got-phished/) they just released!'.
